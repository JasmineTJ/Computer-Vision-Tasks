# Image Feature Extraction and Matching Project

## Overview
This project focuses on extracting unique features from a given set of grayscale and color images, generating feature descriptors, and matching these features using various techniques.

## Tasks to Implement
1. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Extract unique features in all images using the Harris operator and Î»-.
   - Report computation times to generate these points.

2. **Feature Descriptor Generation**: 
   - Generate feature descriptors using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).
   - Report computation time.

3. **Feature Matching**: 
   - Match the image set features using Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) and normalized cross correlations.
   - Report matching computation time.

## Objective
The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of feature extraction, descriptor generation, and feature matching techniques in the context of image processing and computer vision.
