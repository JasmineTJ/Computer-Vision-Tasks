## Assignment 2: Edge and Boundary Detection (Hough Transform and SNAKE)


This repository contains code and documentation for Assignment 2 of the Computer Vision course. The task involves edge detection using the Canny edge detector, detecting lines, circles, and ellipses in given images, and implementing the Active Contour Model (snake) using the greedy algorithm to evolve contours.

## Contents:

1. *Code:* Python scripts for implementing edge detection, shape detection, and Active Contour Model.
2. *Data:* Sample images provided for the tasks. Additional images may be used for testing purposes.
3. *Report:* A comprehensive report summarizing the implementation details, results, and observations.

### Tasks Implemented:

#### A) Edge and Shape Detection
1. Implement the Canny edge detector for all given grayscale and colour images.
2. Detect lines, circles, and ellipses in the images, if present. Superimpose the detected shapes on the images.

#### B) Active Contour Model (SNAKE)
1. Initialize the contour for a given object in the images.
2. Evolve the Active Contour Model (snake) using the greedy algorithm.
3. Represent the output as chain code.
4. Calculate the perimeter and the area inside these contours.
