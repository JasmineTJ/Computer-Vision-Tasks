# Facial Recognition Project

## Overview
This project explores the fascinating field of facial recognition technology. Our study focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to identify and recognize human faces from standard face datasets.

## Datasets
- **AT&T Database of Faces**: [AT&T Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces)

## Methodology
1. **Detect Faces**: Employ methods to detect faces in both colour and grayscale images.
2. **Recognize Faces**: Utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Eigen analysis for face recognition.
3. **Performance Reporting**: Evaluate and report the performance of the implemented techniques.
4. **ROC Curve Plotting**: Construct and analyze the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to understand model efficacy.

## Objective
The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these techniques concerning artificial intelligence and computer vision fields.
