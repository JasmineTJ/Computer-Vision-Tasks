# Image Processing Project

This project is a comprehensive exploration of image processing techniques. It includes:

- Addition of various types of noise to images
- Application of low pass filters for noise reduction
- Implementation of edge detection using Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, and Canny edge detectors
- Plotting of histograms and distribution curves
- Equalization and normalization of images
- Performing local and global thresholding
- Transformation of color images to grayscale
- Application of frequency domain filters
- Creation of hybrid images
- Detection of shapes in images using the Hough transform
- Implementation of the Active Contour Model (snake) for boundary detection
- Extraction of unique features in images using the Harris operator and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
- Matching of image features using Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) and Normalized Cross Correlations
- Unsupervised segmentation of images using k-means, region growing, agglomerative, and mean shift methods
- Face detection and recognition using PCA/Eigen analysis on standard face datasets
- Evaluation of performance by plotting ROC curves

This project provides a broad understanding of image processing techniques and their practical applications.
