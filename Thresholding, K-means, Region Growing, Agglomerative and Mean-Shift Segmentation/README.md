# Image Thresholding and Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on thresholding grayscale images using various methods and performing unsupervised segmentation on grayscale and color images.

## Tasks Implemented
1. **Thresholding for Grayscale Images**:
   - Apply optimal thresholding.
   - Use Otsu's method for thresholding.
   - Implement spectral thresholding (more than 2 modes).
   - Perform local thresholding.

2. **Unsupervised Segmentation for Gray/Color Images**:
   - Apply k-means clustering.
   - Use region growing methods.
   - Implement agglomerative clustering.
   - Perform mean shift segmentation.

## Objective
The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of thresholding techniques and unsupervised segmentation methods in the context of image processing and computer vision.
